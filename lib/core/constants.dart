        'A lyric app that allows users to find and listen to shalawat (praises) to the Prophet Muhammad',
    description: '''
**Sholawatan** is a lyric app that I developed using Flutter and Firebase. It uses a DDD (Domain-Driven Design) architecture, which makes it easy to maintain and extend.

Sholawatan is a great way to learn about and listen to shalawat, and it is a valuable resource for Muslims of all ages.

**Key features:**

* Large collection of shalawat
* Ability to save favorite shalawat
* Ability to share shalawat with others
* Built using Flutter and Firebase
* Uses a DDD (Domain-Driven Design) architecture
* Uses BloC (Business Logic Component) design pattern

**Technical details:**

* The app is built using Flutter, a cross-platform mobile development framework.
* The backend is built using Firebase, a cloud-based platform that provides a variety of services, including database storage, authentication, and real-time messaging.
* The app uses a DDD (Domain-Driven Design) architecture, which helps to keep the code organized and easy to maintain.
* The app uses BloC library, a predictable state management library that helps implement the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern.

**I am proud of this project because it was my first Flutter app with DDD architecture. I learned a lot about DDD architecture while developing this app, and I am confident that I can use these skills to develop other great apps in the future.**

    shortDescription:
        'A compression and convertion App for images (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, and WebP) and audio locally without server',
    description: '''
**CompressIt** is a compression and conversion app that I developed using the Flutter framework. It is a powerful tool that allows users to shrink the size of their images and audio files without losing quality. CompressIt works locally on the user's device, so there is no need to upload files to a server or share them with anyone else.

CompressIt supports a variety of image and audio formats, including JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, MP3, AAC, and WAV. Users can compress files individually or in batches. CompressIt also allows users to set custom compression levels to achieve the desired balance between file size and quality.

**Here are some of the features of CompressIt:**

* Supports a variety of image and audio formats
* Allows users to compress files individually or in batches
* Allows users to set custom compression levels
* Works locally on the user's device
* Easy to use
* Free and open source

**I am proud of the work I did on CompressIt. It is a powerful tool that can be used by anyone to save space on their device, send large files more easily, and improve the performance of their apps.**

**Here are some additional details about the use of Flutter in CompressIt:**

* Flutter is a cross-platform framework, which means that the same code can be used to build apps for both Android and iOS.
* Flutter is known for its high performance and beautiful UIs.
* CompressIt uses many of the features of Flutter, such as its declarative UI, its hot reload feature, and its internationalization support.

I believe that the use of Flutter in CompressIt has made the app more powerful, more user-friendly, and more accessible to a wider range of users.
