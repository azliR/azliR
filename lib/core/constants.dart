**Restaurant App**

I developed the Restaurant App, a mobile app that helps customers order food from their favorite restaurants without having to worry about queues or full tables. The app features a search function that allows users to find restaurants by location, cuisine, or price range. Users can also see the state of the restaurant, such as the current wait time and the availability of tables. In addition, the app allows users to book tables, order food directly from the app, and schedule orders.

The Restaurant App was built using Flutter, Firebase Auth, PostgreSQL, the Bloc library, localizations, and Maps. The app is available on Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

**Key features**

* Search for restaurants by location, cuisine, or price range
* See the state of the restaurant, such as the current wait time and the availability of tables
* Book tables
* Order food directly from the app
* Schedule orders

**Benefits**

* Save time by ordering food from your favorite restaurants without having to wait in line
* Avoid full tables by seeing the state of the restaurant before you go
* Book tables in advance so you don't have to worry about finding a seat
* Schedule orders so your food is ready when you are

**Skills demonstrated**

The development of the Restaurant App demonstrates the following skills:

* Flutter mobile development
* Firebase backend development
* PostgreSQL database management
* Bloc state management
* Localization
* Maps integration
* Cross-platform development

**Conclusion**

The Restaurant App is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to order food from their favorite restaurants without having to worry about queues or full tables. The app is easy to use and features a number of innovative features that make it a valuable addition to any smartphone.
